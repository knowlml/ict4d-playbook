This playbook is about using technological and digital tools as part of the Peace Corps' mission for Volunteers in the field, but what exactly is *ICT4D*? What differentiates ICT4D from basic IT support, and what exactly is *information* for our purposes?



### Defining ICT4D

ICT4D is simply Information and Communication Technologies for (4) Development. As a field of study, it combines various disciplines to offer a more holistic approach to using technology for social good. ICT4D is an academic field of research and education as well as a practioners domain.

One of the leading academics in ICT4D, Richard Heeks, breaks down the acronym a little further—specifically that the 'I' is related to Library and Information Sciences, the 'C' drawing from Communication Studies', the 'T' associated with Information Systems, and the 'D' referring to Development Studies.[^1]

ICT4D has been a sub-field of international development since the 1990s, and has matured in parallel with the field of international development, focusing on community co-ownership and co-development, design-thinking and iteration, and on the end-user and how they can be empowered by rather than exploited by developments in technology and communication.



### What does ICT4D bring to Peace Corps?

One thing that separates ICT4D from say, a more straightforward approach to IT interventions is the explicit focus on impact on people, and in ensuring that the primary focus of any intervention is placed squarely on the well-being of the target group.

This focus on peoples lives and livelihoods is consistent with Peace Corps' approach. Regarding ICT interventions (projects and programs) through this lens demonstrates to us (at least) five reasons that Volunteers will want to think about using an ICT4D approach.

#### 1. Improve the quality of the services Volunteers provide.

At the end of the day, Volunteers have committed themselves to serve for two years -- and they are in their communities to work. In that effort, they make use of the tools, technologies, resources, and assets around them to provide a value-add to their presence in their community, and to do so at the highest quality available and to have the greatest impact.

#### 2. Improve Volunteer's ability to serve more people.

A megaphone allows someone to speak with a louder voice. ICTs can help whole communities speak with a louder voice, and to have a wider reach and broader impact. It can also how Volunteer activities to reach new groups of beneficiaries and underserved populations.

#### 4. Help people to use information to manage better.

Access to tools and technologies is not enough by itself—ICTs can also help to improve the management of projects in and of themselves: everything from project design, monitoring & evaluation, assessment, and learning. ICTs increase efficiency so as to conserve resources.

#### 5. Leverage experience from one project, sector, and Volunteer to the next more effectively.

Volunteers are more effective when they learn from each other, from their predecessors, and when they are teachers to the next group of Volunteers.
