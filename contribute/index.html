  <p class="lead">Thanks for helping to develop the Peace Corps ICT4D Playbook. This guide couldn't be done without the input of Volunteers, staff, and partners -- so please don't be shy about jumping in to add, edit, and improve it!</p>



  <h2>How this site is built</h2>

  <p>In order to contribute, you need a little insight of how things work behind the scenes. Basically there are three components you need just some basic familiarity with:</p>

  <ul class="tools">
    <li class="github"><a href="#Github">Github</a></li>
    <li class="prose.io"><a href="#Prose">Prose.io</a></li>
    <li class="jekyll"><a href="#Jekyll">Jekyll</a></li>
    <li class="markdown"><a href="#Markdown">Markdown</a></li>
  </ul>

  <h3 id="Github">Github</h3>

  <p><a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a web-based repository hosting service, which amongst other things offers revision control and source code management via a web-based graphical interface.</p>

  <h4>Why should I care?</h4>

  <p>Any changes you wish to make, whether they be edits to an existing page, or creating a new one, will most likely be done via the Github website (it is also possible to download and edit the files on your local machine, instructions forthcoming). All the files for this site can be browsed and edited the Github website. You will need to <a href="https://github.com/" rel="external">sign up</a> for a (free) Github account. For full instructions, see <a href="/contribute/editing/">Editing a page</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="Prose">Prose.io</h3>

  <p><a href="http://prose.io/">Prose.io</a> is a simple content editor for GitHub designed for managing websites</p>

  <h4>Why should I care?</h4>

  <p>While it's possible to use Githubs own editing features from the website to create and modify Markdown files, it's a <bold>lot</bold> cleaner and faster link up your Github account with Prose.io, and edit from that interface.</p>

  <hr />

  <h3 id="Jekyll">Jekyll</h3>

  <p><a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> is a static site generator, which allows us to host websites based on our GitHub repositories. Jekyll takes the content, renders Markdown, and produces a complete, static website ready to be viewed on the web.</p>

  <h4>Why should I care?</h4>

  <p>All you really need to know about Jekyll is the method it uses to include metadata (ie. page title). Each page needs to start with a section it calls Front Matter, containing the page title. An example is provided in the <a href="/contribute/adding/">Adding a page</a> section.</p>

  <h3 id="Markdown">Markdown</h3>

  <p><a href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown">Markdown</a> is a markup language with plain text formatting, designed so that it can be converted to HTML. Markdown can be used to create rich text using a plain text editor.</p>

  <h4>Why should I care?</h4>

  <p>Markdown is your key to formatting the text your provide for this site. By learning a few intuitive rules you’ll be able to ensure your text is formatted with headings, list, quotes etc, without writing any HTML. For examples, head to the <a href="/contribute/markdown-examples/">Markdown</a> section.</p>
