### Apps and Applications for coding

- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) -- Program your own interactive stories, games, and animations — and share your creations with others in the online community. There's also the [ScratchEd](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/) portal for walk-throughs and support, [ScratchJr](http://www.scratchjr.org/), which is an app for the iPad and Android tabelts, and this [6-unit Introduction to Scratch from Harvard](http://scratched.gse.harvard.edu/guide/).

- [Kodable](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kodable/id577673067?mt=8) -- iPad, desktop, and Android-compatible; ages 5+; can set up so students can continue where they left off.

- [Lightbot](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/lightbot-one-hour-coding/id873943739) (One-Hour Coding): iPad, Android, and web browser; some reading involved with commands; non-readers cannot use independently

- [Tynker](http://www.tynker.com/hour-of-code/) -- Drag-and-drop coding that eliminates syntax, with option to show the code as text, [school info](http://www.tynker.com/school/) and a [video](http://youtu.be/zK_EWkzmw64); good for K–8; getting started videos to help teachers create a classroom, add students, choose a lesson plan; tutorials and gallery contain ready-to-use projects and lessons; [info about coding for 2nd–7th graders](http://www.tynker.com/blog/articles/teacher-profiles/early-cs-education-in-grades-2-7/)

- [Blockly](https://blockly-games.appspot.com/) -- Game-based programming.

- [Daisy the Dinosaur](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/daisy-the-dinosaur/id490514278?mt=8) -- iPad only; requires some reading; simple block-based programming

- [Hopscotch](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/hopscotch-coding-for-kids/id617098629) -- iPad only; free [ebook](http://www.speedofcreativity.org/2013/11/12/hopscotch-challenges-a-free-curriculum-ebook-for-ipad-coders/) on Hopscotch challenges; angles (90, 180, 360…) would be helpful to know.

- [Karel the Dog on CodeHS](http://code.org/learn/codehs) -- Demos of types of [programs](http://codehs.com/demos); kids are actually typing the code; uses Ruby, not Java; only 4 simple directions, but might be challenging for some students; not sure about iPad usage, but works well on laptops; class setup is needed prior to student use.

- [RoboMind Academy](http://www.robomindacademy.com/go/robomind/home) -- Program to control a virtual robot to move, pick up, paint, etc. using text instructions; fully self-contained online course with short presentations, movies, quizzes and automatic guidance/hints to help with the programming exercises; definitely need a mouse to do this on a Chromebook (zooming and panning around the robot world, scrolling down to get help); good sound effects!; connects “drag-and-drop” programming to a programming language; not a lot of documentation, but you can click “Help” for detailed instructions; introduces loops and conditionals.

- [Code Monster](http://www.crunchzilla.com/code-monster) -- Features two adjacent boxes — one displays code, the other shows what the code does, and as you play around with the code with some help from a prompt, you learn what each command does.
